    <h3 id="top">Are there other solar systems in the Milky Way</h3>
    
    <p>Yes, so many! If you had asked anyone just 30 years ago, the answer would have been "we don’t know". But since then we have discovered already more than 5,000 planets orbiting stars other than our sun (so-called exoplanets). And since often we find multiple of them orbiting the same star, we can count about 4,000 other solar systems.</p>
    
    <h3>Do solar systems move?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely, and in many ways. For one, all the exoplanets orbit their stars, just like our planets (such as Earth and Mars) orbit our sun. In addition, our solar system as well as all of the others orbit around the black hole in the centre of the Milky Way! But what is even more, some of these other solar systems actually have not one, but two or more stars (like Tatooine!) — and then these stars perform a rhythmic dance around each other, together with their exoplanets.</p>
    
    <h3>Do solar systems move?</h3>
    <p>That is the 1 million Euro question. We are currently just exploring what processes drive the formation and evolution of other solar systems, and what we can learn from this about our own solar systems (and Earth’s!) history. We think that many other stars have exoplanets around them but probably not all of them. In average, studies found there to be about 1 to 2 exoplanet per star — but that is an average! Some stars may have 8, others may have none.</p>
